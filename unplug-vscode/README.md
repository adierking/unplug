# Unplug Visual Studio Code Extension

This is a language plugin for Visual Studio Code which adds syntax highlighting and indentation
configuration for Unplug script assembly files (.us).

If you are a user, you can get a compiled .vsix file from a build on the
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/adierking/unplug/actions) page.

If you are a developer and want to test a change to the extension, run the "Extension" launch
configuration from inside VSCode to open a test window.
